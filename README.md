Driver Drowsiness Detection System
Built a real-time fatigue monitoring system that detects driver drowsiness using eye aspect ratio and alerts with a buzzer.
Technologies: OpenCV, Python, Haar Cascade, Raspberry Pi
♦ Implemented eye-blink detection using Haar cascade classifiers and aspect ratio logic.
♦ Triggered audio alert via GPIO-controlled buzzer when drowsiness threshold exceeded.
